# Python-CS50

Welcome to the Python-CS50 repository! This is a systematically organized collection of Python programs crafted during my learning journey with Harvard University's [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4&t=6465s) course.

## About Me

As a motivated and enthusiastic learner, I am committed to mastering Python programming by following this world-class curriculum. This repository reflects my hands-on practice and understanding of core programming concepts through progressively challenging exercises.

## Repository Structure and Contents

The repository is divided into sequential steps, each focusing on key Python programming themes to build solid skills.

### Step 1 - Foundations of Python

**Files:**

- `hello0.py` to `hello11.py`  
- `calculator0.py` to `calculator11.py`

**Summary:**

- **Hello-series (`hello0.py` to `hello11.py`):**  
  These programs introduce basic input/output, string handling, user prompts, and data types. They cover fundamentals of user interaction and simple console messaging.

- **Calculator-series (`calculator0.py` to `calculator11.py`):**  
  Progressive calculator programs demonstrating arithmetic operations, user input validation, type conversions, function creation, and modular code practice.

### Step 2 - Conditionals and Comparisons

**Files:**

- `grade0.py` to `grade3.py`  
- `agree0.py` to `agree4.py`  
- `compare0.py` to `compare5.py`  
- `house0.py` to `house3.py`  
- `parity0.py` to `parity3.py`

**Summary:**

- **Grade scripts (`grade0.py` - `grade3.py`):**  
  Programs implementing grading logic based on score thresholds using if-elif-else conditionals.

- **Agreement scripts (`agree0.py` - `agree4.py`):**  
  Interactive agreements and boolean logic demonstrators with conditional responses based on user input.

- **Comparison scripts (`compare0.py` - `compare5.py`):**  
  Exploration of various comparison operators and logical conditions. These teach how to evaluate relationships between values effectively.

- **House scripts (`house0.py` - `house3.py`):**  
  Practical examples focusing on nested conditionals and decision-making based on multiple criteria.

- **Parity scripts (`parity0.py` - `parity3.py`):**  
  Programs to check if numbers are even or odd, showcasing simple modulus operations combined with conditionals.

### Step 3 - Loops and Iteration

**Files:**

- `cat0.py` to `cat11.py`  
- `mario0.py` to `mario7.py`  
- `hogwarts0.py` to `hogwarts5.py`

**Summary:**

- **Cat programs (`cat0.py` - `cat11.py`):**  
  Pattern printing using loops to print "meows" or similar repeated output, enhancing understanding of iteration.

- **Mario programs (`mario0.py` - `mario7.py`):**  
  Classic stairs and pyramid printing patterns illustrating nested loops and visual output concepts.

- **Hogwarts programs (`hogwarts0.py` - `hogwarts5.py`):**  
  Loop-based programs with more complex logic and patterns inspired by themed exercises.

### Step 4 - Advanced Concepts and Applications

**Files:**

- `number0.py` to `number9.py`

**Summary:**

- These scripts introduce function creation, modular design, and data manipulation. They teach defining reusable code blocks, handling function inputs/outputs, and preparing for practical Python application development.
