# Python-CS50

Welcome to the Python-CS50 repository! This is a systematically organized collection of Python programs crafted during my learning journey with Harvard University's [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4&t=6465s) course.

## About Me

As a motivated and enthusiastic learner, I am committed to mastering Python programming by following this world-class curriculum. This repository reflects my hands-on practice and understanding of core programming concepts through progressively challenging exercises.

## Repository Structure and Contents

The repository is divided into sequential steps, each focusing on key Python programming themes to build solid skills.

### Step 1 - Foundations of Python

This foundational step introduces basic Python syntax, input/output, and simple computation.

#### Hello Series (`hello0.py` to `hello11.py`)

- Demonstrates essential print statements to output text.
- Introduces string manipulation and formatting.
- Focuses on receiving user input for dynamic interactions.
- Teaches basic data handling and console communication.

#### Calculator Series (`calculator0.py` to `calculator11.py`)

- Covers arithmetic operations and mathematical expressions.
- Emphasizes input conversion from strings to integers or floats.
- Introduces function definition and return values.
- Explores formatted output using f-strings.
- Builds towards robust input handling and modular code.

### Step 2 - Conditionals and Comparisons

This step emphasizes decision-making in programming by learning conditional statements and comparisons.

#### Grade Scripts (`grade0.py` to `grade3.py`)
- Implements grading based on numerical score ranges.
- Utilizes if-elif-else logic for branching conditions.

#### Agreement Scripts (`agree0.py` to `agree4.py`)
- Simulate user agreements and boolean logic using interactive prompts and conditional branching.

#### Comparison Scripts (`compare0.py` to `compare5.py`)
- Teach comparison operators and compound logical expressions.
- Evaluate relationships such as greater than, less than, equal to.

#### House Scripts (`house0.py` to `house3.py`)
- Illustrate nested conditionals based on multiple attributes.
- Apply real-world decision-making logic through code.

#### Parity Scripts (`parity0.py` to `parity3.py`)
- Determine number parity using modulus (even or odd).
- Reinforce use of conditionals with arithmetic checks.

---

### Step 3 - Loops and Iteration

This step covers repetitive operations using loops for automation and pattern creation.

#### Cat Programs (`cat0.py` to `cat11.py`)
- Basic to complex loops printing repeated strings ("meow").
- Focus on loop constructs, incrementing, and termination.

#### Mario Programs (`mario0.py` to `mario7.py`)
- Generate classic graphical patterns like pyramids, stairs.
- Utilize nested loops for multi-level iteration.

#### Hogwarts Programs (`hogwarts0.py` to `hogwarts5.py`)
- Advanced pattern printing with thematic twists.
- Reinforce deeper loop logic and conditional combinations.

---

### Step 4 - Advanced Concepts and Applications

Focuses on function creation and modular programming principles.

#### Number Programs (`number0.py` to `number9.py`)
- Develop reusable functions handling inputs and returns.
- Demonstrate modular design techniques in Python.
- Prepare for complex application coding with clean structure.
