# Python-CS50

Welcome to the Python-CS50 repository! This is a systematically organized collection of Python programs crafted during my learning journey with Harvard University's [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4&t=6465s) course.

## About Me

As a motivated and enthusiastic learner, I am committed to mastering Python programming by following this world-class curriculum. This repository reflects my hands-on practice and understanding of core programming concepts through progressively challenging exercises.

## Repository Structure and Contents

The repository is divided into sequential steps, each focusing on key Python programming themes to build solid skills.

### Step 1 - Foundations of Python

#### Hello Series (`hello0.py` to `hello11.py`)

- These scripts introduce the very basics of Python programming focusing on input/output operations.  
- They include simple print statements, string manipulations, greeting the user, and receiving user input.  
- Users learn how Python handles different types of output and how to format strings.  
- Early scripts may just print static strings while later versions take user input to personalize output.  
- The series teaches fundamental concepts like data types, user interaction, and dynamic messaging in console applications.  

#### Calculator Series (`calculator0.py` to `calculator11.py`)

- These scripts build upon the Hello series by introducing arithmetic operations and basic calculations.  
- Early programs compute simple fixed sums or operations.  
- Mid-series start accepting inputs from the user and handling type conversions between strings and numbers.  
- Functions are introduced to encapsulate repetitive or reusable calculation logic.  
- Later scripts explore more advanced concepts such as return statements, formatted output (like f-strings), and robust input handling.  
- This series forms the foundation for understanding variables, expressions, user input processing, and simple function usage in Python.

### Step 2 - Conditionals and Comparisons

#### Grade Scripts (`grade0.py` to `grade3.py`)

- These programs introduce how to use conditional logic to assign grades based on numeric test scores.  
- Early scripts demonstrate basic if-else conditions, whereas later ones use if-elif-else structures.  
- Users learn how to evaluate branching paths and create decision-making flows based on value ranges.  

#### Agreement Scripts (`agree0.py` to `agree4.py`)

- This series focuses on interactive user inputs with yes/no style agreements.  
- It explores Boolean logic, input validation, and conditional responses.  
- Learners see how to assess true/false states combined with logical operators to guide program flow.  

#### Comparison Scripts (`compare0.py` to `compare5.py`)

- These files demonstrate how to compare values using operators like greater than, less than, equality, and inequality.  
- Examples combine comparisons with logical operators such as and/or to evaluate compound conditions.  
- This series deepens understanding of how Python evaluates logical expressions for program decisions.  

#### House Scripts (`house0.py` to `house3.py`)

- These scripts illustrate nested conditional expressions evaluating multiple criteria, simulating real-world decision trees or categorization problems.  
- They teach layering conditions for more complex, nuanced decision-making.  

#### Parity Scripts (`parity0.py` to `parity3.py`)

- These programs check if numbers are even or odd by using the modulus operator combined with conditionals.  
- They reinforce simple arithmetic checks and show how concise logic can solve practical programming tasks.

### Step 3 - Loops and Iteration

#### Cat Programs (`cat0.py` to `cat11.py`)

- These scripts use loops to print repeated strings, such as "meow".  
- Beginning with basic while loops and advancing to for loops and nested loops, they teach loop control structures, iteration counting, and termination conditions.  
- Learners get comfortable with repetition and automation in code.  

#### Mario Programs (`mario0.py` to `mario7.py`)

- Classic pattern printing exercises inspired by CS50's Mario problem sets.  
- These programs use nested loops to build stair-step or pyramid shapes in the terminal.  
- They reinforce skills in controlling multiple iterations and producing formatted output.  

#### Hogwarts Programs (`hogwarts0.py` to `hogwarts5.py`)

- This series features more complex pattern printing exercises often inspired by themed problems like Hogwarts house sorting.  
- These scripts combine loops with conditionals to produce elaborate, varied patterns.  
- They reinforce integrated control logic.

### Step 4 - Advanced Concepts and Applications

#### Number Programs (`number0.py` to `number9.py`)

- Focused on function definitions, these scripts teach creating reusable code blocks with input parameters and return values.  
- Programs include implementing mathematical functions, data validation inside functions, and modular design.  
- This step prepares learners for scalable and maintainable software development practices.
