# Python-CS50

Welcome to the Python-CS50 repository! This project is a curated collection of Python programs created during my learning journey following Harvard University's [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4&t=6465s) course.

## About Me

I am a motivated and enthusiastic learner diving deep into Python programming by leveraging the comprehensive CS50 curriculum. This path reflects my commitment to master programming fundamentals and develop practical coding skills through hands-on practice.

## Repository Structure and Contents

The repository is structured into progressive steps to encapsulate key learning themes from beginner to advanced topics.

### Step 1 - Foundations of Python

**Files:**
- `hello0.py` to `hello11.py`
- `calculator0.py` to `calculator11.py`

**Summary:**
This step covers basic Python programs emphasizing foundational concepts such as printing output, receiving input, handling variables, and simple arithmetic operations. It teaches how to interact with users via input, perform calculations, and output results effectively.

### Step 2 - Conditionals and Comparisons

**Files:**
- `grade0.py` to `grade3.py`
- `agree0.py` to `agree4.py`
- `compare0.py` to `compare5.py`
- `house0.py` to `house3.py`
- `parity0.py` to `parity3.py`

**Summary:**
Focuses on decision-making in code using conditionals and logical operators. These scripts demonstrate how to assign grades based on scores, compare values, check parity (even/odd), and make complex logical decisions guiding program flow.

### Step 3 - Loops and Iteration

**Files:**
- `cat0.py` to `cat11.py`
- `mario0.py` to `mario7.py`
- `hogwarts0.py` to `hogwarts5.py`

**Summary:**
Introduces loops (`while` and `for` loops) to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. Programs simulate classic exercises like printing patterns (e.g., cats, Mario stairs) and counting currency, which hone skills in iteration and program control structures.

### Step 4 - Advanced Concepts and Applications

**Files:**
- `number0.py` to `number9.py`

**Summary:**
Explores creating and using functions, modular design, and implementing more complex logic. This step strengthens program structure, error handling readiness, and data manipulation techniques, preparing for practical, real-world Python programming.
